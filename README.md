# Arcade Game
Arcade is a game that I developed for Udacity front-end nanodegree. The goal is make the player reach from grass to water avoiding enemy bugs, within a set time.
## Playing Instructions
* Allowed keys
    * Up arrow - Moves the player one block up
    * Down arrow - Moves the player one block down
    * Left arrow - Moves the player one block left
    * Right arrow - Moves the player one block right
* A collision between player and bug moves the player back to starting point.
* The game must be completed within **20s** to earn a **score of 1**.
* After the completion of a game, a new game can be started by pressing **Start** button or can be rest by pressing **Reset** button. _Resetting will reset the score to 0_.
* Keep in mind that a new game cannot be started or reset, while a game is in progress.

## System requirements
* Responsive across various devices such as mobile devices, tablets and laptops.
* Any modern web browser.
